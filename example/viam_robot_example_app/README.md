# Viam Robot Example Flutter App

This example app uses Viam's Flutter SDK to connect to and control a specific robot.

For a more fully-featured example with copious documentation, view the `viam_example_app` in the parent directory.

This app was created using VSCode's Flutter plugin and shows the basic use cases for how the Viam Flutter SDK can be used to connect to, view, and control your robot.

## Setup

In this directory (the main project directory) create a `.env` file with the following fields:

```
ROBOT_LOCATION=<ROBOT_LOCATION_URI>
API_KEY_ID=<API KEY ID>
API_KEY=<API KEY>
```

or using location secrets (deprecated, please prefer using API keys!):

```
ROBOT_LOCATION=<ROBOT_LOCATION_URI>
LOCATION_SECRET=<ROBOT_LOCATION_SECRET>
```

Both these fields can be obtained from your robot's `Code Sample` tab on [app.viam.com](https://app.viam.com).

## Run

Run `lib/main.dart`:

```
flutter run lib/main.dart
```
