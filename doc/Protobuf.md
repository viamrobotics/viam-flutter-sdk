# Viam protobuf definitions

Viam uses [protocol buffers](https://protobuf.dev/) for (de)serialization. While native implementations for many of these protobufs exist in the SDK, there can be some instances where direct access to protobuf messages is required. The definitions of all protobufs provided by Viam are listed below.
