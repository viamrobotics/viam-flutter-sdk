## (In)stability Notice

> **Warning**
> This is an alpha release of the Viam Flutter SDK. The only guarantee is that there **WILL** be breaking changes to the API. We will enumerate these changes in the release notes.

## Getting started
Make sure your project meets the minimum requirements:
* Minimum iOS target: 12.0
* Minimum Android SDK: 23

As this SDK is still in alpha, it is not yet published to [pub.dev](https://pub.dev). While we have plans to publish there soon, for now you should install the SDK directly from [GitHub](https://github.com/viamrobotics/viam-flutter-sdk):

```yaml
# pubspec.yaml

...

dependencies:
  ...
  viam_sdk:
    git: 
      url: https://github.com/viamrobotics/viam-flutter-sdk.git
      ref: main
```

Don't forget to run `flutter pub get` after updating your `pubspec.yaml`


## Usage
You can use the Viam SDK to connect to an existing robot (to create a robot, view the [documentation](https://docs.viam.com/) or [try Viam](https://docs.viam.com/try-viam/)).

```dart
import 'package:viam_sdk/viam_sdk.dart';

// Connect to an existing robot
// *NOTE* Get the <LOCATION> and <SECRET> from app.viam.com
final options = RobotClientOptions.withLocationSecret('<SECRET>');
final robot = await RobotClient.atAddress('<LOCATION>', options);

// Print the available resources
print(robot.resourceNames);

// Access a component
final movementSensor = MovementSensor.fromRobot(robot, 'my_sensor');
print(await movementSensor.readings())
```
